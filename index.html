    <p id="about">
        I'm a currently a full-time student pursuing a degree in computer engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.
        I am also involved with Digital Humanities research in the Visual Media Workshop on campus, where I have worked on with some data visualization with facial recognition software.
        I'm incredibly interested in the creative possibilities that exist within the realms of design and technology.
        I crave the new perspective that these two entities bring to life.
        Most of my creative works are done in my free time using Processing.
